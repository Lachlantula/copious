# copious

A stunningly simple backup utility. 📋✨

## Installation

### Run from Source

```sh
# Install all dependencies. ⬇️
yarn
# npm i

# Run copious. 🎉
yarn run dev
# npm run dev
```

---

### Binaries

Operating system-specific binaries are coming soon. macOS and ()Arch) Linux support are priorities personally, but pull requests for Windows-supported packages are welcome. 😊

## Purpose

copious is designed to be simple, set-and-forget, yet manual and powerful if need be. Whilst the application may not exactly follow the suckless coding style, it intends to be functionally simple and programatically fairly trivial (aside from the bustling Electron backend, which may change in the future).

## Credits

copious is powered by the fantastic [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) project. Thank you!
